# USB File Sorter

My car stereo supports playing mp3 files off of a USB thumbdrive. Unfortunately,
it doesn't always sort files and folders alphabetically. Instead, it sorts them
based on the order they were put onto the drive. Some internet searching reveals
I am not the only person with this problem: [1], [2], [3] (and many others).

This is a little script that I use to solve the problem. It's pretty simple and
could be extended with more features and a GUI, etc. I just wanted to upload it
for posterity and in hopes that it might help someone else with the same
problem.

## Usage

Install [Node.js].

1. Delete all the files from your USB drive.
2. Change `sourcePath` and `destPath` to appropriate folders for your computer.
3. Run `node app.js` and wait as the files are copied over.

## Future Features

* GUI
* Pass command-line arguments instead of hard-coding constants
* Do the re-ordering without having to delete everything and copying (I'm not
  sure if this is even possible, but would be worth looking into)
* Visual feedback as the files are copied over

## Car Stereo Models

This list is of car stereo models that need the fix. Useful for SEO when people
are searching for their model number.

* Pioneer AVH-P2400BT
